              <p>
                I am a detail-oriented IT Service Desk and Monitoring Specialist with over 7 years of experience in IT operations, 
                system monitoring, incident management, and technical support primarily within the banking and financial sector.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout my career at Kenya Commercial Bank Group, I've held various roles of increasing responsibility, 
                from Service Desk Analyst to Technology Banking Operations Manager. I've demonstrated a proven ability to monitor 
                critical infrastructure, coordinate preventive maintenance, and generate detailed operational reports.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm also the founder of Tech Ace Solutions, where we provide innovative IT solutions to businesses. My team and I 
                are committed to leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and enhance operational efficiency.
              </p>
              <p>
                Recently, I've undertaken a professional development break to enhance my skills in Data Science, DevSecOps, 
                AWS Cloud Computing, and Web Development, obtaining certifications that complement my extensive IT background.
